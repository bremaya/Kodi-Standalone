# Kodi Standalone Portable
Kodi puts your smart TV to shame. Kodi plays almost every kind of media you can find and looks great while doing it!


Run Kodi (https://kodi.tv) in Portable Mode (https://kodi.wiki/view/Portable_mode) and correct enviroment select (x86 or x64) and can be integrated with PortableApps Platform (https://portableapps.com).

This is a personal project, not related with Kodi Team or PortableApps (but it be integrated with PortableApps Platform).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).
This is packed with Kodi 19.4 (Matrix) in Portable mode and correct enviroment select (32 or 64 bit).
